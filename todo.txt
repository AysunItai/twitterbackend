git init
git add .
git commit -m "init project and setup the crud endpoints"
after installation of prisma we have to initialize its schema
npx prisma init --datasource-provider sqlite
after schema prisma creations we define 
by model correspending table 
vs code prisma extension
after finish with database schemas next step is data migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name "init"
that migration commands is a list of sql 
commends ;
take the database from previous state to a new state
for example you changed something in the database so 
you create a new migration

how to visualise database?
npx prisma studio

querying our database:

next step is we need to install prisma client
npm install @prisma/client
start implementing prisma client in user routes
const prisma = new PrismaClient();
now through this prisma we are able to interact with
our database
list users
